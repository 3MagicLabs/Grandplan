## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project planning spine: `SPEC.md` (requirements), `RESEARCH.md` (prior art / techniques / feasibility).
- Repository hygiene: README, LICENSE (MIT), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, CONTRIBUTING, ADRs.
- CI mirroring the borromeo quality gate; Dockerfile for a reproducible core test environment.
- borromeo governance (`borromeo.toml`) — deterministic build/hygiene/format/lint/typecheck/test/security gate.
- Planning model (SPEC §11, ADR-0004/0005): one append-only graph; plans/masterplan/decks as projections;
  horizons, entities, deadlines, contexts; Reconciler (build-on/refine/supersede/contradict-flag);
  workspaces + capability plugins; multi-medium renderers — MVP slice vs deferred phases made explicit.

### Notes
- Greenfield: no application source yet. Phase 0 (gated core, lossless-first TDD) is next.
